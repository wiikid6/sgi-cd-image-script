# SGI CD Image Ripping Script

## Description

This script allows linux users to accurately rip SGI IRIX discs. This is needed as the block size is a little wonky.
It also is required to make the disc bootable. However, as far as I know, as soon as it's ripped using this script,
it should burn fine under any burner. It also does a simple verification process to make sure that the image was
extracted correctly. If anyone wants to make a more advanced version of this, where it errors out if it's
unreadable, or as a GUI application, I would appreciate it!

## Instructions

TBD
